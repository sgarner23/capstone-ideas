# IOU Tracker

## IDEA:
IOU Tracker is a SaaS SMB tool to aid small businesses in tracking their paid and pending invoices. Instead of tracking invoices via paper and old school filing cabinets, IOU will help digitalize and simplify invoicing paperwork so that business owners can spend more time on what's important. Their customers.  

## Features:
* Create a user account 
* Create, read, update, and delete custom company invoices
* Receive form validations when trying to create/edit invoices 
* Save draft invoices and be able to update invoice status (draft/pending/paid) 
* Filter invoices by status
* Toggle between light and dark mode on the app

## Future Features: 
* add a dashboard with graphs to show invoice history 
* Create an internal tool for the IOU customer service team that completed the following:
  * Collected customer comments and feedback while users were using the app
  * Gathered that data and performed sentiment analysis on it through NLP and Machine Learning 
  * Gave the customer service team a dashboard that displayed all the sentiment analysis feedback with a customer health score (the future of NPS is sentiment analysis!)
